        <h1>HISTORY</h1>
        <p>
          The Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) was
          established through the enactment of Republic Act No. 7796 otherwise
          known as the "Technical Education and Skills Development Act of 1994",
          which was signed into law by President Fidel V. Ramos on August 25,
          1994. This Act aims to encourage the full participation of and
          mobilize the industry, labor, local government units and
          technical-vocational institutions in the skills development of the
          country's human resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          The merging of the National Manpower and Youth Council (NMYC) of the
          Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE). The Bureau of Technical and
          Vocational Education (BTVE) of the Department of Education, Culture
          and Sports (DECS), and The Apprenticeship Program of the Bureau of
          Local Employment (BLE) of the DOLE gave birth to TESDA.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fusion of the above offices was one of the key recommendations of
          the 1991 Report of the Congressional Commission on Education, which
          undertook a national review of the state of Philippine education and
          manpower development. It was meant to reduce overlapping in skills
          development activities initiated by various public and private sector
          agencies, and to provide national directions for the country's
          technical-vocational education and training (TVET) system. Hence, a
          major thrust of TESDA is the formulation of a comprehensive
          development plan for middle-level manpower based on the National
          Technical Education and Skills Development Plan. This plan shall
          provide for a reformed industry-based training program that includes
          apprenticeship, dual training system and other similar schemes.
        </p>
