            <p>The Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) is the government agency tasked to manage and supervise technical education and skills development (TESD) in the Philippines. It was created by virtue of Republic Act 7796, otherwise known as the “Technical Education and Skills Development Act of 1994”.

TESDA’s vision is to be ‘the transformational leader in the technical education and skills development of the Filipino workforce.’ TESDA sets direction, promulgates relevant standards, and implements programs geared towards a quality-assured and inclusive technical education and skills development and certification system.</p>

    <h1>Overview of Tesda</h1>
    <p>TESDA was formed by Republic Act No. 7796, also known as the "Technical Education and Skills Development Act of 1994," which was signed into law on August 25, 1994 by President Fidel V. Ramos. The goal of this act is to encourage and organize business, labor, local government, and technical-vocational institutions to invest in the nation's human resources.
Its goal was to avoid duplication of skill development programs undertaken by various public and private sector groups, as well as to give national direction for the technical- vocational education and training (TVET) system. Given this, one of TESDA's primary goals is to design a comprehensive development plan for middle-level individuals based on the National Technical Education and Skills Development Plan.</p>
